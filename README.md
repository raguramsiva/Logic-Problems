# LogicProblems
A repository of solutions to problems in Mathematical Logic, Set Theory, Computability and Complexity Theory, and Modal Logic. 

These subjects are broadly spread across Mathematics, Computer Science and Philosophy. However, they are intimately connected subjects historically.

Collectively, this repoisitory contains hundreds of pages worth of logic problems intended to be used for reference purposes.
